    So far, got the project to be ready to run on a server;
        1. Install && run the .sql file on MySQL somewhere on a server
        2. As for Macs, run php server by command "php -S localhost:9000"
        3. To run this in a server // cloud environment, I might have to take extra steps
            to install && configure the necessary softwares.

    Following are some of the things I need to finish doing to have the service run smoothly
        1. The MySQL DB configuration on this machine doesn't match that of the project.
            The project needs a checkup && update.
        2. Certain operations don't seem to be doing well, so a total checkup with the entire project run may be necessary

    Patched up the MySQL DB configuration along with the Session being tangled up.

    The My Orders page for some reason does not exist. Gotta make a decision either to build this page or leave it as is, 
    since this was simply a school project meant to implement CRUD functionality on MySQL DB.

    Might be a smart idea to keep track of && record the configuration process for xampp and mysql on the cloud server i'll be getting.

    Fixed the apache2 not loading the php website properly problem; it was an issue with apache2 not having loaded the appropriate modules.
    Referenced a post on medium about installing && running apache at the following link.
