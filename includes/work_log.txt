    So far, got the project to be ready to run on a server;
        1. Install && run the .sql file on MySQL somewhere on a server
        2. As for Macs, run php server by command "php -S localhost:9000"
        3. To run this in a server // cloud environment, I might have to take extra steps
            to install && configure the necessary softwares.

    Following are some of the things I need to finish doing to have the service run smoothly
        1. The MySQL DB configuration on this machine doesn't match that of the project.
            The project needs a checkup && update.
        2. Certain operations don't seem to be doing well, so a total checkup with the entire project run may be necessary
